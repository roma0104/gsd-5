# Note: 
After many years, and some personal events that kept me from being active I am planning to return to development on this project in a very basic level. However, I will continue development at Gitlab and this project will be archived here. Please visit the Gitlab project if you need further help.

Please fork the project and continue to grow it in your own vision. I am excited to see what others have created so far.

# GSD5

A Getting-Things-Done tool for the TiddlyWiki5 environment.

GSD5, or Getting-Stuff-Done 5, is a plugin for [TiddlyWiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com) *[(github)](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/)* that attempts to combine the workflow and philosophy of David Allen's **[Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/)** with the TiddlyWiki5 platform.  GSD5 is heavily influenced by [mGSD](http://mgsd.tiddlyspot.com/) for TiddlyWiki classic.

GTD® and Getting Things Done® are registered trademarks of the [David Allen Company](http://www.davidco.com). GSD5 is not affiliated with or endorsed by the David Allen Company.

# Obtaining

To the fun stuff or at least more productive!

### Stable(ish)

GSD5 is most definitely a work-in-progress project and beta quality.  There might be changes that might break from past versions in ways that make forward comptatiblity of user-created content non-trival to correct.

### Nightly

To try GSD5's latest commits without having to build it yourself.

*Nightly builds are performed 01:00 UTC*

### Building

If you wish to build GSD5 as a standalone file:

- Clone [TiddlyWiki5](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/)
- Clone this repo (or your fork of it). Make sure the two repos are side by side, rather than with one inside the other's directory.
- Change directory to the top level of the GSD5 directory.
- To serve GSD5 using node.js run `bin/serve.sh`, then visit <http://localhost:8080> with your browser.
- To build an empty GSD5 file run `bin/build.sh`.

Note there are currently no .cmd equivalents of the serve.sh and build.sh scripts for windows users (but perhaps you can write them based on the bash versions).

*This method will build against the latest commits from both TiddlyWiki5 and GSD5, things may be broken or act oddly.  Checkout to latest releases for both if you want a more stable build.  I usually test with Chromium.*
